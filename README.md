I break, fix, and rebuild systems to understand them.

##  About Me

I'm into hands-on infrastructure, security tooling, and scripting.  
Most of what I build starts in the lab, networks, VMs, and tools and I'm shifting toward version-controlling it here instead of letting it collect dust in my home directory.

Currently rebuilding this GitHub to reflect what I *actually* do: document, test, break, and repeat.
